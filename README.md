# LyXTufteThesis

A LyX template for PhD theses at HU Berlin. This is tailored to be compliant with the rules of
the Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Fakult√§t.

## Some Notes

* In order to compile this document with `biblatex` instead ot `natbib`, I tweaked the LyX-layout to
not include `natbib.sty` by standard. If you're using the layout-file, please note that you have to
load the document class with the `nobib` option for it to work.
* The toc in tufte-book is usually rather slim with references to chapters only. Since this is not
compliant with the standard toc of dissertations, load the class with the `notoc` option
* I've added the following additional preamble
```latex
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}

\usepackage{titlesec}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{afterpage}

\newenvironment{changemargin}[2]{%
\begin{list}{}{%
\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}%
\setlength{\leftmargin}{#1}%
\setlength{\rightmargin}{#2}%
\setlength{\listparindent}{\parindent}%
\setlength{\itemindent}{\parindent}%
\setlength{\parsep}{\parskip}%
}%
\item[]}{\end{list}}


\geometry{bindingoffset=0.9cm}

\usepackage{xpatch}
\AtBeginDocument{\xapptobibmacro{cite}{\setunit{\nametitledelim}\printfield{year}}{}{}}

```
